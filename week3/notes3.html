    <h1>Notes for week 3</h1>    
    <section>
         <h2>Programming basics</h2>    
         <h2>Variables</h2>
            <p>Variables are used in programming languages to refer to a value stored in memory.</p>
        <h2>Primitive Data Types</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>String</li>
                <li>Number</li>
                <li>Symbol</li>
                <li>Boolean</li>
                <li>Undefined</li>
                <li>Null</li>
            </ol>
            <p>*Any value that isn’t one of the primitive data types listed above is an object. (example -  arrays, functions and object literals)</p>
        <h2>Scope</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Global scope</li>
                    <p>It is accessible everywhere in the program</p>
                <li>Local scope</li>
                    <p>This means that any variables defined inside a block using the let or const will only be available inside that block and not be accessible outside of that block.</p>
            </ol>
        <h2>Template Literals</h2>
            <p>A special types of string that were introduced in ES6. Template literals use the backtick character, ` , to deliminate the string.
                This means that a JavaScript expression can be inserted inside a string and the result will be displayed.
                Template literals can also contain line breaks, which are all converted into a Line Feed (\n)</p>
        <h2>Hard equality</h2>    
            <p>NaN is the only value in JavaScript that is not equal to itself</p>

        <h2>Arrays</h2>
        <p>An ordered list of values</p>
        <h2>Methods</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>pop</li>
            <li>shift</li>
            <li>push</li>
            <li>unshift</li>
            <li>concat</li>
            <li>join</li>
            <li>slice</li>
            <li>splice</li>
            <li>reverse</li>
            <li>sort</li>
            <li>indexOf</li>
            <li>includes</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Sets</h2>
        <p>An empty set is created using the new operator and Set() constructor</p>
        <h2>Maps</h2>
        <p>A convenient way of keeping a list of key and value pairs, and are similar to
            “hashes”, or“hash tables” or “dictionaries” in other programming languages.</p>
        <h2>Loops</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>while loop</li>
            <li>do while loop</li>
            <li>for loop</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Function</h2>
        <p> A chunk of code that can be referenced by a name, and is almost like a small, self-contained mini program. Functions can help reduce repetition and make code easier to follow.</p>
        <h2>Declaration</h2>
        <p>To define a function literal we can use a function declaration. This starts with the function keyword and is followed by the name of the function.  
            ES6 introduced a new way to define functions, using what is known as “arrow” notation.</p>
        <h2>Invoking a function</h2>
        <p>To invoke a function, simply enter its name, followed by parentheses.</p>
        <h2>Parameters and Arguments</h2>
        <p>Parameters and arguments are terms that are often used interchangeably to represent values provided for the function as an input.</p>
        <p>There is a subtle difference though: any parameters a function needs are set when the function is
            defined. When a function is invoked, it is provided with arguments.</p>
        <h2>Arrow Function</h2>
        <p>Arrow functions can be identified by the arrow symbol, => that gives them their name. The parameters come before the arrow and the main body of the function
            comes after. Arrow functions are always anonymous, so if you want to refer to them, you must assign them to a variable.</p>
        <h2>Callbacks</h2>
        <p> A function that is passed as an argument to another is known as a callback.</p>
