    <h1>Notes for week 4</h1>    
    <section>
         <h2>Forms</h2>    
         <h2>Accessing Form Elements</h2>
         <p>The legacy DOM had a useful property called document.forms that returns an HTML collection of all the forms in the document in the order they appear in the markup</p>
         <h2>square bracket notation</h2>
         <p>this is required if the form’s name attribute contains any invalid characters, such as spaces or dashes</p>
         <h2>form.submit() method</h2>
         <p>It will submit the form automatically. Note that submitting a form using this method won’t trigger the form submit event</p>
         <h2>form.reset() method </h2>
         <p>It will reset all the form controls back to their initial values specified in the HTML
            A button with a type attribute of reset can also be used to do this without the need for additional scripting</p>
        <h2>form.action property</h2>
        <p>It can be used to set the action attribute of a form, so it’s sent to a different URL to be processed on the server</p>

        <h2>Object-Oriented Programming</h2>
        <p>A style of programming that involves separating the code into objects that have properties and methods</p>
        <h2>The Prototype Property</h2>
        <h2>Finding Out the Prototype</h2>
        <p>One way is to go via the constructor function’s prototype property.
           Another way is to use the Object.getPrototypeOf() method, which takes the object as a parameter</p>
        <h2>What Should the Prototype Be Used For?</h2>
        <p>The prototype can be used to add any new properties and methods after the class has been declared</p>
        <p>Be careful when overwriting the prototype completely ― the constructor class needs to be reset</p>

        <h2>HTML5</h2>
        <h2>The data- Attribute</h2>
        <p>The data- attribute is a way of embedding data in a web page using custom attributes that are ignored by the browser</p>
        <h2>Format</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Start with data-</li>
            <li>Contain only lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, dots, colons or underscores</li>
            <li>Include an optional string value</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Geolocation</h2>
        <p>The Geolocation API is used to obtain the geographical position of the device</p>
        <h2>Multimedia</h2>
        <p>HTML5 introduced the <audio> and <video> tags used to insert audio and video clips into a web page. It also introduced a Media API for controlling the playback of the clips using JavaScript</p>
